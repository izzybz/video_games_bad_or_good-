        <h1>Why You Should Play Video Games</h1>
         <p>first of all if you are a person who isn't very social you could find and meet 
         new people and become (online) friends with them. Video games can also be a way 
         to play will friends who used to live near you and are now far away from were 
         you live. Video games are also a way to just have fun with others and just get
         away from real life for a bit and relax with your friends online. I am saying you
         should do this but you could because you could make money from gaming 
         (if you are good)because gaming is its own type of sport (esports) you won't 
         make as much money as Ballbasket players make but you're still making money.</p>
         
         
         <h2>Why You Shouldn't Play Video Games</h2>
          <p>Video games are fun to play but a good amount of the time video games can
          be bad for you such as playing to much, because if you play way to much 
          your eyes could start hurting,you could be wasting time, you could be in side 
          almost all day, and if you stay up late playing you will not get enough sleep.</p>
