        <h1>The Video Game Hobby </h1>
        
              <p> A hobby that me and other people have is gaming, I game so I can talk and hang 
          out with my friends even if they are in a different state in the U.S. or anywhere
            if they have internet and a device to play on. Many people hate on gaming yes 
            gaming doesn't really have any physical aspics unless you are playing a game
             such as just dance but video games can be good for other things. There are
             video games being created to help people with sickness or to find out earlier
             that they have a sickness. Also video games have helped people become more 
             social for example i used to be very shy and after a while of playing video 
             games i have become more social because I met other people online and made
             new friends about my age. Video games also get you thinking and using your 
             brain because you have to react to different things and in some games you have
             get people and you need to work together to get something done that is not
              very simple.</p>
