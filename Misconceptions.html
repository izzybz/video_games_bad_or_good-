            <h2>10. Games Cause Headaches</h2> 
            <p>In the older days of video games when there was games such as pinball
             wizard and the old CRT and flashing cathodes used in games of the lod school 
             stripe were notorious for being hard on eyesight which caused headaches. But
              today people play games for many hours and don't get a headache this is 
              because of how technology has changed</p>
              
              <h2>9. Video Games Make People Violent</h2>
              <p>Many studies were make to try to prove that people who play violent games 
              and all of them haven't proven that video games can make people violent. 
              There are two statistics that prove that the opposite is more likely to be 
              true</p>
              
              <h2>8. Video Games Aren't Art</h2>
              <p>Many people say that video games aren't art but if you look for more
               info the artist are the highest paid out of all the other people making 
               the video game this is because video games take time and hard work to make
                and if video games weren't art there would be a new game such as GTA every year because
                 it would be so easy to make.</p>
                 
                 <h2>7. Playing Video Games Makes you Antisocial</h2>
                 <p> It is said that video games make you sit down playing video game 
                 all day alone a very small amount of people who play video games alone 
                 and this group is made up of people who have anxieties and depression 
                 issues. Some studies show that most people who play video games 
                 socialize more in a day then some people in a whole do in a hole week</p>
                 
                 <h2>6. Gamers Are Unhealthy </h2>
                 <p> Many people believe that almost all gamers are Unhealthy but a study 
                 done by Michigan State University proved that teenager who play video games 
                 are no more prone to being overweight than the general population of 
                 peers.</p>
                 
                 <h2>5. Gamers And Games Are Sexist </h2>
                 <p> Yes this one is Borderline true but now video game publishers notis
                 that many of the people who play their game are female so they are 
                 dropping many of the female cliches.</p>
                 
                 <h2>4. Video Games Are Like Crack</h2>
                 <p>people who are easily addicted to stuff could become easily addicted
                 to video games but the same goes for drugs and other substances. Since 
                 about 62% of gamers play with other people and their friends gaming can't 
                 really count as an addiction unless you re playing 24/7.</p>
                 
                 <h2>3. Only Males Play Video Games</h2>
                 <p> Many gamers are males but a large amount of gamers are also females; 
                 about 48%(2010) of gamers are females.</p>
                 
                 <h2>2. Video Games Make You Stupid</h2>
                 <p> many people think that gamers are just sitting down and leting their 
                 brains rot and you're  just pressing buttions but video games do the 
                 opposite because video games make you try to figure out things and this 
                 is always ture for games make for little kids around 3.</p>
                 
                 <h2>1. Games Are For Kids</h2>
                 <p> this is the most common cliche and yes little kids play video games 
                 but if all gamers were kids why would there but games created such as Gta
                 ,Call of duty, and Titanfall? These types the games are the most common 
                 games you can find and thats because 68% of gamers are over 18 years of 
                 age and this is because all these people played video games when they
                  were little and now they are grown up and some of them still play video
                   games today.</p>
